                        Hi, I am a 21 years old guy from Poland. I have done an IT Technician course in high scool. That made me stay there a year longer. However, ait was worth it since I have gathered so much professional experience there. I also have finished my class with the certificate and can call myself an IT Technician. I have programmed for three years in C++. I mostly broke down and coded algorithms. That was what my final exams in Computer Science was about. I have also learned about hardware and networking. In my final years, I learned more about databases and web development. Therefore, I have experienced almost all aspects of CS. Apart from Computer Science, I am very interested in electronic music! My favourite artists are Alison Wonderland, Flume and Yellow Claw. During the lockdown, I have purchased a Pioneer controller for myself, and I am practicing mixing music. In my free Ttime, I love to read a book or play video games with my friends.

                        The development of the game has taught me a lot about OOP. Thanks to that, I have understood the concept of objects, encapsulation and polymorphism.  This three months project has been troublesome sometimes, like shooting. I think I spent a couple of hours making the shooting accuracy. The mouse position, character's position, width and height had to count to put the bullet in the correct place around the object and with the respective velocity. Then the menu, transferring the panels to be a pause or main menu and launching the pause menu to stop the simulation from running in the background + passing the focus. That also took me a while.
                        Overall, the game has been a great project to learn the principles of OOP.

                        My first programming project was made during one of the practicals before I found out that we are having a project the next week. When completed the tasks I've tried to make this little bouncing ball game we all know from our childhood (at least I remember..). <br>
                          I've created a circle that moves with a randomized velocity. At start the range is from 5 to 6 but it speeds up with every picked point that appears in random places on the screen. This project demonstrates an understanding of proper if statements and how to set the mathematical conditions.
