                        Hi, I am 21 years old guy from Poland. I have done an IT Technician course in high school which made me stay in there a year longer but it was worth since I have gathered so much experienced. I also have finished my class with the certificate and can call myself an IT Technician. I've programmed for 3 years in C++, mostly broke down algorithms and coded them since that was my final exam in Computer Science was about. I have also learned a lot about hardware, networking and in my final years I did databasases and web development. So, I've had a try of almost everything CS is about. 
                        Besides Computer Science I am very interested in music! Most of it is electronic. My favourite artists are Alison Wonderland, Flume, Yellow Claw and many more! During lockdown I have bought for myself a beautiful Pioneer controller and I am trying to mix things up since then. In my free time I love to sit back and read a book or play a video game with my friends. <br>

                    <p class="text-lead">
                        My first programming project was made during one of the practicals before I found out that we are having a project the next week. When completed the tasks I've tried to make this little bouncing ball game we all know from our childhood (at least I remember..). <br>
                          I've created a circle that moves with a randomized velocity. At start the range is from 5 to 6 but it speeds up with every picked point that appears in random places on the screen. This project demonstrates an understanding of proper if statements and how to set the mathematical conditions.
